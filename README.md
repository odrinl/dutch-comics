# Dutch Comics App

Link to the app - https://dutchcomics.netlify.app/

## My ideas

To sort by series a huge database of vintage comics in Dutch, located in the Internet archive. Make it more convenient to use and to give people easy access the separate issues of every series in pdf format.

### MUST-HAVE
1. Home page with title, footer and all series
2. Page with issues in selected series
3. Page of issue with link to pdf, which opens in additional window
4. Possibility to add issues to reading list and save them in storage
5. Responsive design (media-queries)
   
### NICE-TO-HAVE
- Make tests for the application
- Developer page with possibility to leave a feedback
- Section with popular comics
- Search in titles
- Load pdf inside the app with option of saving the last position in memory
- Translation of selected regions in pdf

### Design
Design I was trying to do in a funny style of vintage colourful comics. 

## Project requirements

- The app needs to have multiple pages and use client-side routing
- The app should make use of the Context API or use custom hooks
- You can either use an API that you have built or access to (then just include the backend code in the project) or should use data from a public API. _You will not be graded on backend code_
- You should not use class components
- You are *not* allowed to do a code-along or tutorial for this project, the goal is for you to build something yourself!
- Follow the [guidelines for technical assignments](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/ta_guidelines). This will help you not get stuck or end up with only half an application and make sure that what you have at the end is something presentable. Your README should also be filled with information for potential recruiters/reviewers
